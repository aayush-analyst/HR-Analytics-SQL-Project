# HR-Analytics-SQL-Project
SQL project for HR data analysis using MySQL â€“ includes database creation and analytical


##  Project Overview
This project demonstrates SQL skills using MySQL to analyze HR datasets.  
We created and managed two related tables: `employees` and `jobs`.  
The project includes data cleaning, table joins, aggregation, and analytical queries.

---

##  Dataset
- **employees**: Employee details (ID, Name, DOB, Gender, Marital Status, Citizenship)
- **jobs**: Job information (Role, Department, Salary, Manager, Hire Date)

---

##  Tools Used
- MySQL 8.0
- CSV datasets

---

##  Key SQL Operations
1. **Database & Table Creation**
2. **Data Import using `LOAD DATA INFILE`**
3. **Data Cleaning** (handling NULLs, date formats)
4. **Joins** between `employees` and `jobs`
5. **Aggregations** (COUNT, AVG, SUM)
6. **Filtering** with `WHERE` clauses
7. **Sorting** and **LIMIT** for top results

WHERE j.Salary > 70000;


9. Find the earliest hired employee.
SELECT e.EmpID, e.Employee_name, j.DateofHire
FROM employees e
JOIN jobs j ON e.EmpID = j.EmpID
ORDER BY j.DateofHire ASC
LIMIT 1;

FROM employees e
JOIN jobs j ON e.EmpID = j.EmpID
ORDER BY j.Salary DESC
LIMIT 10;


12. Find the department with the highest total salary expense.
SELECT Department, SUM(Salary) AS Total_Salary_Expense
FROM jobs
GROUP BY Department
ORDER BY Total_Salary_Expense DESC
LIMIT 1;
